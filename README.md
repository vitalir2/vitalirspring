Plan for project:
- We have auth
- Every client has his appointments
- We have list of services / doctors for observation
- Admin / Client
- Client can register an appointment with a doctor that has free time in that period
- Admin can add / remove / update services / doctors from the website
- Client can change his appointment list (remove them but at least 1 day until the appointment, add)

* GET -> get,
* POST -> add,
